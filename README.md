# Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project explores and analyzes a dataset related to breast cancer patients. The dataset consists of 213 observations from the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital cancer registry, covering a period of 24 months (January 2019–August 2021). The primary objective is to understand the relationships between various patient features and the diagnosis result (benign or malignant) through data analysis and visualization.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**  
   An overview of breast cancer, its components, and how it spreads.  
   *(For reference: [CDC - What is Breast Cancer?](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/basic_info/what-is-breast-cancer.htm))*

2. **Dataset Explanation**  
   Detailed information about the dataset, including the features and target variable.

3. **Data Dictionary**  
   A breakdown of the dataset features:
   - **S/N:** Unique identifier for each patient.
   - **Year:** Year of diagnosis.
   - **Age:** Patient’s age at the time of diagnosis.
   - **Menopause:** Menopause status (0 = postmenopausal, 1 = premenopausal).
   - **Tumor size:** Tumor size in centimeters.
   - **Involved nodes:** Presence of metastatic lymph nodes (1 = present, 0 = absent).
   - **Breast:** Affected side (1 = left, 0 = right).
   - **Metastatic:** Whether the cancer has spread to other organs (1 = yes, 0 = no).
   - **Breast quadrant:** Quadrant of the breast affected.
   - **History:** Patient’s or family history of breast cancer (1 = yes, 0 = no).
   - **Diagnosis result:** Target variable indicating benign or malignant cases.

4. **Data Analysis**  
   This section outlines the steps taken to analyze the dataset:  
   - **4.1 Import Libraries:** Necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.  
   - **4.2 Import Dataset:** Loading and understanding the structure of the data.  
   - **4.3 Data Description:** Summary statistics and distribution analysis of features.  
   - **4.4 Noise Detection:** Identifying and handling anomalies or inconsistencies.  
   - **4.5 Separation Dataset:** Splitting data for training and testing purposes.  
   - **4.6 Visualization:** Graphical representation of feature distributions and relationships.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary**  
   A comprehensive summary of insights derived from the dataset analysis and visualizations.
